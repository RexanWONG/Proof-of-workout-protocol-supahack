- Reserve: 2.1 million POW tokens (5%)

## Mining Mechanism

Just like Bitcoin, POW tokens are "mined" through the completion of fitness quests. The amount of POW rewarded for each quest gradually reduces over time, similar to Bitcoin's halving mechanism. This scarcity mimics the diminishing returns of mining Bitcoin and ensures a continuous incentive for early adoption and consistent use.

## Burning Mechanism

To further manage the supply and increase the value of the POW tokens, a token burning mechanism is incorporated. Every time a user fails to complete a quest, 5% of their POW tokens are burned or permanently removed from the circulation. This mechanism effectively reduces the total supply of tokens over time, potentially increasing the demand and value of the remaining tokens.

## Staking Mechanism

Users stake their ETH to commit to a fitness quest. Upon completion, they are rewarded with their staked ETH and newly minted POW tokens. If they fail to complete the quest, they lose their staked ETH, and a portion of their POW tokens are burned, reducing the overall supply.

## Token Utility

The POW tokens serve as a measure of a user's fitness activity level and achievements within the app. In addition to acting as a score for the leaderboard, POW tokens could have further utilities. They might be used to access premium features or quests, create additional demand for the token, and further integrate the token into the platform's economy.

## Deflationary Mechanism

The POW token's deflationary nature, resulting from the capped supply, token burning, and staking mechanisms, creates the potential for its value to increase over time. As more users join the platform and participate in quests, the token supply decreases due to burning, which can potentially increase the demand for tokens. If the platform's adoption grows, the POW token's value is expected to rise. This potential for appreciation provides an additional financial incentive for users to earn and hold POW tokens.

## Maximum Cap on Token Distribution

To ensure a balanced and sustainable growth of the Proof of Workout (POW) ecosystem, a maximum cap on the number of POW tokens that can be distributed in any single event or quest is set. For this version of the dApp, the cap is set to 5000 POW tokens. This cap ensures that the token distribution remains fair, inflation is controlled, and the tokenomics remains stable.

## Halving Mechanism
A crucial feature of the POW token economics is the implementation of a "halving" mechanism, similar to Bitcoin's, aimed at controlling token inflation and stimulating value growth over time.

When the total circulating supply of POW tokens that are allocated for fitness quest completions (the 24 million POW tokens) falls below specific thresholds, the maximum number of tokens that can be distributed for any single event or quest will be halved. This reduction will lower the rate at which new tokens enter the circulation, thereby diminishing inflation and potentially increasing the demand and value of the POW tokens.

In the first era, there are altogether 24 million POW tokens allocated to fitness quests completions.
The POW tokens are given out to reward participants who have accomplished quests. Each quest is capped to 5,000 POW tokens.
When 12 million POW tokens are given out as rewards or partnership, the first era is completed and the second era begins.
In the second era, the reward per quest will be reduced by half to 2,500 POW tokens per quest. When a further 6 million POW tokens are given out, the second era is completed.
Then the third era begins while the reward for the same quest is further reduced by half to 1,250 POW tokens. When altogether 3 million POW tokens are given out, the third era is completed.
Subsequently, the 4th era will have 3 million POW tokens left; and there will be 1.5 million POW tokens left for the 5th era. The balance for POW tokens for the subsequent eras will be 750K (6th era), 375K (7th era), 188K (8th era), 94K (9th era), 47K (10th era), and 24K (11th era).
Now at the 11th era, all the remaining 24K POW tokens will be used to reward participants, and all the future rewards will only be given away by partners, which will give away rewards to users who complete a quest while participating in partnersâ€™ events, for example, a sports company giving out rewards to participants who wear a pair of sneakers from the sports company and complete a quest.

By introducing this halving mechanism, we aim to strike a balance between ensuring a steady supply of POW tokens for rewarding users while also creating scarcity to sustain and potentially increase the token's value. This mechanism encourages long-term user engagement and fosters a healthy, sustainable token economy.


Please note that this formula and the cap are subject to revision in future versions of the dApp based on user feedback, market dynamics, and the growth of the ecosystem.
